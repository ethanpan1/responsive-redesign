      <h1> Responsive Redesign - Central Meat Market </h1>
    </div>

    <div class="header-text">
      <p>
        For this project, I practiced responsive design. I redesigned a website for
        a local butcher shop, using lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes to develop my redesign.
        I learned a lot more about how to use html, CSS, and a bit of Javascript.

      <h3> Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
      <div>
        I chose the website for <a href="centralmeatmarket.com">Central Meat Market</a> to redesign.
      </div>

      <div class="img">

      <p>
        I immediately noticed a number of usability problems. I also used WebAIM WAVE
        and a screen reader to test for accessibility issues.
      </p>
      <table style="width:80%">
        <tr>
          <th class="th-e">Efficiency</th>
          <th class="th-l">Learnability</th>
          <th class="th-m">Memorability</th>
          <th>Accessibility</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1. Broken image links</td>
          <td>1. Vague navbar titles - Butcher service vs. wholesale meat vs. products all are too similar</td>
          <td>1. Navbar is not organized in any obvious way. </td>
          <td>1. Low contrast between text and background colors. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Shifting colors and fonts create false hierarchies</td>
          <td>2. Unclear matchup between navbar and body (e.g., different ordering)</td>
          <td>2. Lack of specials tab makes it hard to locate in the future.</td>
          <td>2. Images had random names and no alternative text, which was bad for the screen reader.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3. General clutter</td>
          <td>3. Weekly specials and packages are in one subheading but link to separate pages.</td>
          <td>3. Navbar breaks some conventions (e.g., contact is not placed first or last). </td>
          <td>3. Empty headings and links</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4. Repetitive links (two links leading to the same COVID notice right next to each other in different colors)</td>
          <td>4. Only some images link.</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>4. No page regions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5. Not responsive (text does not wrap when resizing desktop screen, always three column layout) </td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="subheading">
      <h3> Part 2: Visual Redesign </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
      I then created lo-fi prototypes. They are annotated with how they address the
      usability issues above.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="RR-Lofi-Prototypes_Page_1.png" width="1000" height="370">

      <div class="img">
        <img src="RR-Lofi-Prototypes_Page_2.png" width="770" height="540">

      <div class="img">
        <img src="RR-Lofi-Prototypes_Page_3.png" width="800" height="470">
      </div>
      <br>
      I've included annotations for how certain elements help fix the usability problems.
      <br>
      <br>
      <table style="width:80%">
        <tr>
          <th class ="th-e">Efficiency</th>
          <th class="th-l">Learnability</th>
          <th class="th-m">Memorability</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1. All images work</td>
          <td>1. Changes to clearer navbar titles</td>
          <td>1. More organized navbar (COVID notice first) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Consistent color scheme and font sizes</td>
          <td>2. More consistency between navbar and main parts of the body (e.g., subheading names)</td>
          <td>2. Specials placed in navbar</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3. Less clutter (title moved away from navbar)</td>
          <td>3. Packages + Specials as one page clarifies heading</td>
          <td>3. Better adherence to conventions (contact last). </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4. Single link to COVID policies (no repeat links)</td>
          <td>4. Images consistently don't link.</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5. Responsive design (flexbox, font size management) </td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <br>

      Then, I created hi-fi prototypes in Figma.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Desktop-Hifi.png" width="1000" height="320">
      </div>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="Tablet-Hifi.png" width="800" height="470">
      </div>

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Phone-Hifi.png" width="900" height="420">
      </div>

      I've annotated the key design elements. Note that the main container is not marked, as it contains the upper and lower frames of each prototype.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Elements.png">
      </div>

      When screens are small, there is also the sidenav (shown in the final phone prototype).

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Sidenav elements.png" >
      </div>

      I then created a visual design style guide.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Responsive Redesign Style Guide.png" width="800" height="550">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subheading">
      <h3> Part 3: Responsive Redesign </h3>
    </div>


    <div class="part">
      <a href="https://responsive-redesign-site.herokuapp.com/">This is my final website.</a>

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Website-1.png" width="800" height="400">
      </div>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="Website-2.png" width="800" height="400">
      </div>

      I tested it for responsiveness in multiple ways. The website handles window resizing very well,
      since the font size changes according to multiple media queries. It was a little less
      responsive with font resizing, mostly because of the main page-title-container; I wasn't able
      to find a way to media query against font size settings. WebAIM WAVE only detected contrast errors
      in the website. I worked hard to prevent contrast errors, so it was interesting that it still picked
      up on them. This exemplifies the value of such resources.

    <div class="subheading">
      <h3> Final Reflections </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
      The most valuable part of this project was learning how to transfer designs from lo-fi prototypes
      to hi-fi ones to websites. I learned that making good decisions early makes the rest of the process
      much easier, and keeping a neat workflow is key to efficiency.
